# ðŸ›  Algorithm Challenges (Bot Protection, Chop Array, Palindrome)

This repository contains three different algorithms that I developed as part of the Patika+ Mobile Developer Bootcamp.

## ðŸ“Œ Projects

### ðŸ”¹ Bot Protection

An algorithm that detects bot activity in a game. If **a sequence of 3 sequential commands repeats at least twice**, it returns the repeated command.  
**Usage:**

```sh
node botProtection.js
```

### ðŸ”¹ Chop Array

A function that splits a given array into subgroups with a specified number of elements. Any remaining elements are placed in a separate group.  
**Usage:**

```sh
node chopArray.js
```

### ðŸ”¹ Palindrome

A function that checks whether a given word is a **palindrome**.  
**Usage:**

```sh
node palindrome.js
```

## ðŸ“‚ Installation & Running

Follow these steps to run the project:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KaanCaman/Native-JS-Project.git

# Enter the project folder
cd project-folder

# Run the desired file
node filename.js
```
